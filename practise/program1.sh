## ---------- Example of the solution Practice/Program 1   -----------------

# -----  Write a shell script that displays a message on the screen, then terminates the program with a 200 output response. 
#        As a reminder, in http services, the 200 output code translates that everything went well                          ------------

echo "This script will return an exit status 200"
exit 200
